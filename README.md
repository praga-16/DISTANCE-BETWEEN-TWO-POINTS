# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two values from the user.
### Step 2:
prepare the program for distance between two points 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4:
print the values using distance formula 
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
  #Program to find the distance between two points.

import numpy as np

l1=[10,6]

l2=[4,2]

distance=np.sqrt(((l1[0]-l2[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))

print("{:.2f}".format(distance))


### OUTPUT:
